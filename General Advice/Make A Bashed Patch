A key suggestion to eliminate most crashes is to MAKE A BASHED PATCH. Bashed patches help to retain certain data that could be lost from improper conflict resolution from multiple patches and mods. There are many tutorials out there on how to make one, but my favorite is by Wazalang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVn0VelT-ic. However, please skip the merged patch tutorial. There are better ways of achieving this. Bashed patches should be the FIRST thing you have before assessing your crash log as not having it paints a false picture of what is really causing one's issue.
