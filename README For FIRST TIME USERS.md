# Crash-Bonanza
This is a central place where people can post some of the common crashes that the community faces and the possible fixes and advice to workaround and prevent these issues. What started out as a guide on Nexus will hopefully become a place whether my sistrens and brethrens from the entire modding community (Steam, Nexus, Reddit, Love*****, and others) can come together to make the ultimate Skyrim experience a commonality for everyone(at least until ES6 comes out). 
# Github Process
The way I have this setup is that users can upload a noted problem or crash with its apparent fix. It would be great to have it in the same format that I have for the other crashes, but if you don't, and the crash has been proven to be a common issue amongst the community, I can edit it and accept the pull request. I already have set folders for the type of crashes/freezes that occur. If there is something that is out of the scope of the folders mentioned, you can still make a pull request out of the folders and I will check it out.
