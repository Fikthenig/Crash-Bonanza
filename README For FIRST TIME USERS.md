# Crash-Bonanza
This is a central place where people can post some of the common crashes that the community faces and the possible fixes and advice to workaround and prevent these issues. What started out as a guide on Nexus will hopefully become a place whether my sistrens and brethrens from the entire modding community (Steam, Nexus, Reddit, Love*****, and others) can come together to make the ultimate Skyrim experience a commonality for everyone(at least until ES6 comes out).
