*This is described as the game freezing for an indefinite period of time with the BGM still playing and no way to move or exit the game. Only way out of this situation would be through task manager. This is a tricky issue that many in the community are still unsure what to make of it. Many have either given up or have found their own solutions to this issue. Granted, solutions and cause of freeze will differ amongst each other, and I therefore invite a conversation regarding this topic.
MY EXPERIENCE: My experience with this issue has, so far, garnered towards FACEGEN FILES that were not generated properly. Usually, this would cause blackface. However, if it is a custom npc, possibly with their own proportions or race like mine did, then this could cause a crash if files were updated but not regenerated through CK by the mod author. Unfortunately, since there is no crash log, the only way to hunt down this issue is to find an area where you can replicate the save, then proceed by disabling plugins in chunks(preferably 10 mods), until the issue doesn't reappear.
COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE: There has been very few testimonials on what other things could cause this:
Overlay Shaders: Mods like Wet and Cold or R.A.S.S could be the cause of this issue. This could arise from a conflict issue with other mods that have a similar function or possibly the engine unable to handle multiple overlays at once. This is a topic I hope will get more addressed in the community soon.

Pelagius Wing Freeze: This is a well known issue in LE that hasn't been fixed in SE. Essentially, upon being transported into the Mad Pelagius mind, having more than a 999 count of a specific item could induce a freeze. This, of course, can be alleviated by reducing the count to a number below this. This type of freeze may also occur in situations or quests that are similar to this one in which your total inventory has to be modified (This specific theory has not been tested but should not come as a surprise if it occurs).
------------------
Overclocking: This is something that can be overlooked when hunting CTDs but overclocking can reproduce this freeze. This tends to present itself with possibly a black screen before returning back to the game with a freeze and background music playing. Sometimes, a black screen may not appear and the freeze will just occur. Obviously, the best way to curb this issue is to decrease your overclock settings and test in game to see if the issue appears again. I have personally always had issues playing Skyrim with an overclocked GPU and the few times that I've tried would result in heavy CTDs, PC restarts, or game freezes.
