*This is described as the game freezing for an indefinite period of time with the BGM still playing and no way to move or exit the game. Only way out of this situation would be through task manager. This is a tricky issue that many in the community are still unsure what to make of it. Many have either given up or have found their own solutions to this issue. Granted, solutions and cause of freeze will differ amongst each other, and I therefore invite a conversation regarding this topic.
MY EXPERIENCE: My experience with this issue has, so far, garnered towards facegen files that were not generated properly. Usually, this would cause blackface. However, if it is a custom npc, possibly with their own proportions or race like mine did, then this could cause a crash if files were updated but not regenerated through CK by the mod author. Unfortunately, since there is no crash log, the only way to hunt down this issue is to find an area where you can replicate the save, then proceed by disabling plugins in chunks(preferably 10 mods), until the issue doesn't reappear.
COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE: There has been very few testimonials on what other things could cause this. One that I have heard is mods that utilize overlay shaders like Wet and Cold could cause it. This might be a conflict issue with other mods that have a similar function or possibly the engine unable to handle multiple overlays at once. This is a topic I hope will get more addressed in the community soon.
