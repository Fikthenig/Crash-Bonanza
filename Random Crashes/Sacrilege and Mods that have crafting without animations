Sacrilege and Mods that have crafting without animations
*Essentially, this CTD occurs when feeding as a vampire with Sacrilege enabled. If you were then to craft an item that doesn't have an animation (mods like Honed Metal, Hunterborn, Campfire, etc.), a CTD occurs. EnaiSiaion describes the situation as follows: "Skyrim seems to have a bug somewhere that causes furniture activations to "remember" things from the previous animation. I imagine there would be no issue if the new furniture plays an animation of its own and overrides the memories. If it doesn't, it may try to recall the feed animation, but it's a paired animation and there's no target, so it crashes."
FIX: The Mod author has put out an update, reverting the feeding animation back to vanilla. This may fix the issue. Needs Confirmation!!
