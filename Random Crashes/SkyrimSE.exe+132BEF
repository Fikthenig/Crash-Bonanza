*This is yet another crash that, from multiple testimonies, seems to be linked with a head mesh. Similar to the crash mentioned above, a face or head mesh from an NPC is corrupted, improperly exported, or is loaded with a malignant conflict and is causing the CTD. Mods like Ordinary Women, for example, require that both the mod order(the mod pane on the left in MO2) and the load order (mod pane on the right) takes precedence when using the mod. This means both should be loaded after any other mods that modify these meshes. 
FIX: The fix will vary since the cause of the head mesh corruption or conflict will differ between each mod. The first like of action would be to work out any potential mod conflicts that may arise from the modification of said head part. Like the previous crash entry, to identify which NPC is leading to the crash, simply use your HDT-SMP log located in your documents folder under Skyrim Special Edition and navigate to the bottom of the page. There it would list the name of the NPC the game tried to load but failed. Once identified, figure out which mods modify that character and reorder your load order and mod order accordingly to make sure that absolutely nothing overwrites it. If it comes out to not being a conflict issue, then it may be corrupted. If there is an update that fixes the mesh for that specific mod, you should try to obtain that first. If that doesn't work, other options would be trying to fix this yourself using CAO or any other methods you may be aware of. If all fails, best line of action would be to disable said mod until further workup is issued by mod author.
