*This is yet another crash that, from multiple testimonies, seems to be linked with a head mesh. Similar to the crash  mentioned above, a face or head mesh from an NPC is corrupted or improperly exported and is causing the CTD. 
FIX: The fix will vary since the cause of the head mesh corruption will differ between each mod. The best line of action would be to disable whatever mod is overwriting the NPC's head mesh. Like the previous crash entry, to identify which NPC is leading to the crash, simply use your HDT-SMP log located in your documents folder under Skyrim Special Edition and navigate to the bottom of the page. There it would list the name of the NPC the game tried to load but failed. If there is an update that fixes the mesh for that specific mod, you should try to obtain that first.
