*This is usually associated with an engine issue(out of the scope of what the log could properly read). Certain mods can bring this issue to light but might not necessarily be a bad mod. This would need superb sleuthing to find the issue. So far, this has occurred with face lighting mods. Specifically, Facelight Plus has also been known to have CTDs with this issue and has been recommended to switch to a converted Oldrim version without Autoconversation-Illuminate(one without the facelight feature). Many are pointing to face illumination mods as a probable cause for this specific issue and is likely to get ammended by a future update in SSE Engine Fixes!! stay tuned!!!
