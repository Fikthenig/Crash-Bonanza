Skyrim Immersive Creatures(SIC) Pups and Cubs CTD
Possible Relevant Objects: Any Wolf Pup or known Cubs from SIC
*Essentially, this is a crash that occurs when you get near or around these little cute animals. This is a bug that has plagued both SIC and SIC official patch.
FIX: Officially, there is no fix.....yet. So far, an unofficial fix has been implemented in HellLizard's Enemy Variation Wenches(EVW) and Dynamic Customizable Soundtrack(DCS). Further discussion with the mod author points to a problem that arises from the AI packages that the pups refer to. It doesn't work properly and causes the CTD. Reverting back to vanilla AI fixes the issue and stops it from occurring. I have had EVW since its inception and can confidently state it works, however confirmation from others would be helpful. Until an official fix is uploaded, there IS a way of doing it yourself. Simply edit all the _00LvlWolfPup, _00LvlBearCubs, and _00LvlSabreCatCubs under Non-Player Character(Actor) in xEdit by changing the Template Flag to allow Use AI packages. There should be a total of 8 entries to modify. With these changes, there is no need to turn off additional spawns. There are quite a few other crashes from this mod, so I suggest running both SIC and SIC official patches under CAO with medium optimization to fix any other issues that may arise.
