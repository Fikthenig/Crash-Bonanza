Skyrim Immersive Creatures(SIC) Pups and Cubs CTD
Possible Relevant Objects: Any Wolf Pup or known Cubs from SIC
*Essentially, this is a crash that occurs when you get near or around these little cute animals. This is a bug that has plagued both SIC and SIC official patch.
FIX: Officially, there is no fix.....yet. I have been discussing this crash with a friend of mine who use to have this crash but fixed it. Essentially, the problem arises from the AI packages that the pups refer to. It doesn't work properly and causes the CTD. Reverting back to vanilla AI fixes the issue and stops it from occurring. I have had this fix for sometime and can say it works but would love confirmation from others. There is no need to turn off additional spawns or anything like that. Until my source decides to post the fix(when he/she gets permission), there IS a way of doing it yourself. Simply edit all the _00LvlWolfPup, _00LvlBearCubs, and _00LvlSabreCatCubs under Non-Player Character(Actor) in xEdit by changing the Template Flag to allow Use AI packages. There should be a total of 8 entries to modify. There are quite a few other crashes from this mod, so I suggest running both SIC and SIC official patches under CAO with medium optimization to fix any other issues that may arise.
