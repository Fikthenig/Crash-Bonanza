*This is associated with a broken nif file. Unfortunately, it is hard to discern which mod is the issue since the log is created after the nif file has been processed. In cases like these, a broken nif can even lead to NO CRASH LOG BEING GENERATED AT ALL!! 
FIX: When put in this situation, one can systematically root out the cause of the issue by disabling each mod in one's load order and starting a new test save to replicate the issue, or running CAO(Cathedral Assets Optimizer) over all your mods. While the second option can fix the issue, it can also bring issues of its own, depending on the level of optimization you choose in CAO. Not only is the first option more accurate, but it will help others be aware of faulty meshes or nif files that plague this mods. The downside is the time it takes to deal with the issue. Therefore, I suggest disabling about 10 mods each test save from the bottom of the load order up. If you are lucky enough to know which surrounding area contains the nif file that is broken, it can be much easier to relocate to that location every save file to ensure the CTD's appearance.
