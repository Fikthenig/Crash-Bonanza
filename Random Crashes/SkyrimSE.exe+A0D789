*This is a random crash that is associated with animation mods or tweaks in ai. Advice is to look at when it occurs and target mods that you know affect this. Some people have noticed this occurs when certain dragons melee stomped with their tail(Fix on the Ultimate dragons page if used). I have noticed this crash also occurs for when you enable a tweak in bashed patch that is already being modified by another mod.
FIX: While the fix may vary depending on the situation of your crash, if you have DAR, then it is possible that is a load order conflict within DAR that leads to crash. Specifically, there may be another mod using the same animation folder number. This can easily be fixed by changing the numbers of the folders to a higher number(higher priority) that isn't assigned already.
