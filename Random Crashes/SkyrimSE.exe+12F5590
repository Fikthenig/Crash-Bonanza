*This issue, from my experience and multiple testimonies from other members of the community, points to an unupdated facegen file for a specific NPC. Facegen issues can appear in different forms from crashing like this to complete freezing as mentioned below. This crash will be recurrent and as long as the character is present, it will crash. 
FIX: The fix is as simple as regenerating the facegen file for that specific npc or the entire mod as a whole using Creation Kit. The difficult part, however, is identifying the mod in question. In Relevant Objects, it will point to a specific head attributed to a specific race. For example,  BSDynamicTriShape(Name: `MaleHeadNord`) points to a Nord Male that would be causing the crash. If you can identify the npc and what mod it originates from or could be affecting their appearance(assuming it is a vanilla npc), then you can use Creation Kit to regenerate the facegen. There are numerous instructions on how to regenerate facegen files on the internet, so don't be afraid to do some research.
