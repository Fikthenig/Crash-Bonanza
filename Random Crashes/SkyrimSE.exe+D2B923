*This is a crash that I have seen from many script logs as of late, but no known cause or fix has been found. There seems to be a bigger issue at hand, and I am hoping more people come out with this crash and what attributable scenario or action caused this CTD to occur. So far, my guess is this could be a save issue. Some have reported this to be caused by Save System Overhaul(SSO) while others who don't have this mod has this CTD occur when going to bed using Alternate Start-LAL after creating their character(a process that ends with the creation of an autosave).
