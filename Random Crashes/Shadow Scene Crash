*This crash has been known to appear with a combination of lighting, camera, and behavior issues. People have mentioned facelight mods to also be a cause for this issue. I have had this issue numerous times in the past, however, and haven't used a facelight at all. This issue may be resolved in a future update in SSE Engine Fixes!! stay tuned!!!
WORKAROUND: Simply deleting any mods with facelight could be of help as that has been a source of multiple types of CTDs in this guide so far
