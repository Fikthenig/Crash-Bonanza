SmoothCam.dll+xxxxx
*This is a CTD involving the mod SmoothCam. I have had this issue occasionally myself and seems to happen quite randomly. 
FIX: Since this mod is a beta, there is some issues in terms of compatibility that could be worked out. My suggestion is if you are having this crash, try disabling some of the compatibilities options in the MCM. The compatibility for Improved Camera, at least for me, was the main source of this crash and unticking that patch stopped this from occuring. If you have enabled or disabled anyone of the patches in the MCM, try experimenting to see if one of them may the cause of your crash.
